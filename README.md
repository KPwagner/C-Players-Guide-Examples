2. [Variables and Types (Chapters 5 and 6)](https://github.com/KPwagner/C-Players-Guide-Examples/tree/master/Variables): declaration, assignment, and naming conventions. Simple and string types. Relevant code: [Variables/Program.cs](../master/Variables/Program.cs)
3. [Basic Math (Chapter 7)](https://github.com/KPwagner/C-Players-Guide-Examples/tree/master/BasicMath): addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. Remainder/modulus operator. Unary operators. Compound assignment. Relevant code: [BasicMath/Program.cs](../master/BasicMath/Program.cs)
4. [User Input (Chapter 8)](https://github.com/KPwagner/C-Players-Guide-Examples/tree/master/CylinderCalculator): user input from the console, converting types, escape characters, and string interpolation. Relevant code: [CylinderCalculator/Program.cs](../master/CylinderCalculator/Program.cs)
5. [More Math (Chapter 9)](https://github.com/KPwagner/C-Players-Guide-Examples/tree/master/MoreMath): integer division, implicit and explicit typecasting, infinity, MinValue and MaxValue, overflow and underflow, incrementing and decrementing. Relevant code: [MoreMath/Program.cs](../master/MoreMath/Program.cs)
6. [Decision Making (Chapter 10)](https://github.com/KPwagner/C-Players-Guide-Examples/tree/master/DecisionMaking): if, else, and else if statements; relational operators, the ! operator, conditional (and/or) operators(&&/||), ternary operator (?).
